### Activity 01 
#### 2. Creating a branch

--

#### Demonstration -  creating a branch in the first repo.

--

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

- design1.html
- design-with-navbar.html
- final-design.html

--

#### What is a good solution for this?

![hello-world](./images/branching.png)

--

- Click the Code tab of your **Notes** repository.
- Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says main.

![hello-world](./images/branch-selection-dropdown.png)

--

- Type a branch name - **activity1-notes**, into the text box.
- Click Create branch: activity1-notes from main.
![hello-world](./images/new-branch.png)

--

- Now you have two branches, main and activity1-notes. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.

--

#### Exercise - create a new hello-world repo and create a new branch called 1-edit-readme

---

#### Activity 01 
### 3. Editing and committing changes

--

#### Demonstration - making changes and committing it in the first repo.

--

- Under the activity1-notes branch you created, click the README.md file.

--

#### Exercise - create a branch in your first repo

---

#### Activity 01 
### 4. Opening a pull request

--

#### Demonstration - Creating a PR in my repo, and mentioning my friend’s name

--

- Click the Pull requests tab of your activity1-notes repository.
- Click New pull request
- In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, activity1-notes, to compare with main (the original).

--

- Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.
![hello-world](./images/diffs.png)

--

- Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

--

- As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
- By using GitHub's @mention feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.

--

- You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

--

#### Exercise - Creating a PR in hello-world from branch(1-edit-readme) and mention your  friend’s name that you have finished doing it

---

#### Activity 01 
### 5. Merging your pull request

--

#### Demonstration - merge your activity1-notes branch into the main branch.

--

- Click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main.

![hello-world](./images/pullrequest-mergebutton.png)

- Click **Confirm merge**. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.

--

- Click **Delete branch**.

Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the 1-edit-readme branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.

--

#### Exercise - Merge your 1-edit-readme branch into the main branch in hello-world repo. 

After you merge your pull request, the changes on your 1-edit-readme branch will be incorporated into main.

---

### Activity 02 
#### Create your profile using README

You can create your custom profile that would be displayed whenever some user visits your profile.

--

#### Exercise - Create a repo and name it your username and include a README file while creating the repo.

- [X] Use the markdown cheatsheet
- [ ] For comprehensive understanding, refer to this article from Github

--

Markdown consists of a set of symbols inserted in a document ending with .md suffix to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.
